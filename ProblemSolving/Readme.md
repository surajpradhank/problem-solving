# Terminologies in Binary Tree

<Details>

## Nodes
The fundamental part of a binary tree, where each node contains data and links to two child nodes.

## Root
The topmost node in a tree, known as the root node.  
- It has no parent and serves as the starting point for all nodes in the tree.

## Parent Node
A node that has one or more child nodes.  
- In a binary tree, each node can have at most two children.

## Child Node
A node that is a descendant of another node (its parent).

## Leaf Node
A node that does not have any children, or both children are `null`.

## Internal Node
A node that has at least one child.  
- This includes all nodes except the root and the leaf nodes.

## Depth of a Node
The number of edges from a specific node to the root node.  
- The depth of the root node is zero.

## Height of a Binary Tree
The number of nodes from the deepest leaf node to the root node.

## The diagram below shows all these terms in a binary tree.
